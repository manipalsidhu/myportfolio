		<td><strong>Balkar Sidhu </strong><strong>Mar 24, 2021</strong><br><br>Sahil 
		is the best I could have hoped for in a realtor, truly exceptional. He 
		was very helpful and responsive without ever needing to be prompted. His 
		knowledge of, and pulse on the real estate market was indispensable in 
		getting me a new home. The whole process was made seamless despite all 
		the details involved. I couldn't have had a better experience.<br><br>
		<strong>Sadia Tariq </strong><strong>Mar 2</strong><strong>7</strong><strong>, 
		2021</strong><br><br>&nbsp;I was looking into buying my first home, and had
		Sahil
		as my agent. He was extremely helpful and willing to answer any and all 
		questions I had about the home buying process, including about 
		mortgages, house inspections, etc. He is a very good communicator and 
		was quick to respond whenever I reached out. From setting up our search 
		criteria to arranging home visits to negotiating on our behalf and 
		finalizing the purchase and close, he made every step a breeze.<br></td>
